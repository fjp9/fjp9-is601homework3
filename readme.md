# Homework 3

In this homeowork I will design my own calculator. The calculator needs to do the following:

1. Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.
2. Throw exception for divide by zero and test that the exception is thrown.
3. Use at least one class, at least one static method, at least one class method.
4. It needs to  store a history of calculations, so that you can retrieve the last calculation, add a calculation.
5. It needs to have 100% test coverage, pass pylint, and you need to do your best to not repeat any lines of code.  
6.  You should use type hints for input parameter types and return types.
7.  Implement a pytest fixture to test.
